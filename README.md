#  COVID-19 Chest X-Ray Classification using HOG and Machine Learning

This project aims to automatically **classify chest X-ray images** into two categoriesâ€”**COVID-19 infected** and **Normal**â€”using a combination of **handcrafted features (HOG)** and traditional **machine learning algorithms** such as **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**, **Random Forest**, and **XGBoost**.

Unlike deep learning-based approaches, this solution demonstrates the effectiveness of classical computer vision + ML pipelines, which are computationally lightweight and do not require large-scale GPU infrastructure.

##  Motivation

During the COVID-19 pandemic, medical imaging such as chest X-rays became a crucial tool for rapid screening and diagnosis. While deep learning methods can provide high accuracy, they require large annotated datasets and high computational powerâ€”resources that may not be readily available in every medical facility.

This project explores an **alternative lightweight solution** using:
- **HOG (Histogram of Oriented Gradients)** for image feature extraction
- **Traditional machine learning classifiers** for prediction

This approach is interpretable, fast, and efficient, making it ideal for real-time or low-resource environments.

##  Dataset

- **Source:** [COVID-19 Radiography Database (Kaggle)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tawsifurrahman/covid19-radiography-database)
- **Used Subsets:**
  - `COVID`: Chest X-rays of patients infected with COVID-19
  - `Normal`: X-rays of healthy individuals

The dataset contains high-resolution grayscale images. Only the **COVID** and **Normal** classes are used in this experiment to perform binary classification.

---

## Problem Statement

> **Objective:** To build an efficient binary classifier that can distinguish between COVID-infected and Normal chest X-rays with high accuracy using traditional machine learning.

The classifier should:
- Handle grayscale images
- Extract meaningful visual features
- Output accurate labels based on non-deep-learning techniques

##  Feature Extraction: HOG (Histogram of Oriented Gradients)

###  Why HOG?

HOG is an effective and lightweight technique that captures **edge structures**, **shapes**, and **gradients** in localized image patches. These are essential features in medical imaging, where abnormal lung textures or opacities can indicate disease.

### ðŸ”¬ How HOG Works

1. **Convert to Grayscale:** Simplifies analysis by removing color dimensions
2. **Resize to 128Ã—128:** Standardizes image dimensions for feature extraction
3. **Gradient Computation:** Calculates edge directions in small regions
4. **Cell Histograms:** For each 8Ã—8 pixel cell, computes a histogram of gradient directions (9 orientations)
5. **Block Normalization:** Groups of 2Ã—2 cells are normalized to account for contrast differences
6. **Feature Vector Construction:** All block histograms are concatenated into a single feature vector

### HOG Parameters Used

| Parameter           | Value         |
|---------------------|---------------|
| Image Size          | 128 Ã— 128     |
| Orientations        | 9             |
| Pixels per Cell     | (8, 8)        |
| Cells per Block     | (2, 2)        |
| Block Normalization | `L2-Hys`      |

##  Machine Learning Models

After feature extraction, the dataset is split into **training (80%)** and **testing (20%)** sets. Feature scaling is applied using `StandardScaler` to ensure all features are on the same scale.

###  Models Trained

- **Support Vector Machine (SVM)** with RBF Kernel  
- **Random Forest Classifier**  
- **XGBoost Classifier**

These models were selected for their:
- Robustness to overfitting
- Generalization performance
- Effectiveness on small- to medium-sized datasets
- Ease of interpretability and tuning

- **Confusion Matrix**
- **Accuracy**
- **Precision**
- **Recall**
- **F1-score**

### âœ… Results Summary

| Model                  | Accuracy (%) |

| Support Vector Machine | **97.30**    |
| Random Forest          | 95.67        |
| XGBoost                | 96.10        |

> **SVM achieved the highest accuracy**, indicating strong performance in distinguishing between COVID-19 and Normal chest X-rays using only handcrafted features from HOG.
